This project was created as practice, following this Angular tutorial by Traversy Media:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdf5aTYRW0E&ab_channel=TraversyMedia

I followed along and decided to put the code on GitHub so that anyone can use it as a reference while learning.
The code is heavily commented.
I also gave some of the variables more descriptive names as there were too many "todo" variables and people said they were getting confused in the Youtube comments.

The commit history gives timestamps, so you can find which part of the video that commit was made at.
For example, to see what the codebase looked like at 45 minutes and 8 seconds, go to commit dac445d.

Please also note that the tutorial seems to be a bit out of date and so the finished project doesn't work perfectly.
- To-do objects you add (at run-time) won't appear with their title property.
- And checking them off will throw a console error. But otherwise, the project is complete.

Thank you for checking out my Github. I hope you're having as much fun learning webdev as I am :)
